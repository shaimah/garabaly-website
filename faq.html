          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Garabaly is West Africa's trusted livestock marketplace. It's a mobile app that connects livestock sellers with buyers — and the diaspora with home — with built-in escrow protection and real negotiation for every transaction. You can browse cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry — all verified with photos, seller profiles, and health certificates.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Garabaly is available across West Africa and is expanding rapidly through the Sahel region. We serve buyers and sellers in multiple countries, with plans to grow into Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger, and more. The diaspora can use Garabaly from anywhere in the world — Paris, London, New York, Washington DC, Brussels, Montreal, and beyond.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Garabaly is completely free for buyers — no platform fees, no commissions, no hidden charges. The price you see is the price you pay. A small platform fee is charged to sellers and service providers upon successful transactions only.</p>

We're adding Bambara, Mooré, Hausa, Fulfulde, and Wolof as full interface languages based on user demand. Total estimated: 1,300+ translatable strings, all human-reviewed — not machine translated.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Garabaly is purpose-built for West African livestock trade. Unlike generic marketplaces, we have escrow protection on every transaction, a dedicated negotiation feature (because "add to cart" doesn't exist in a Sahelian market), veterinary health certificates, voice descriptions in local languages, and special support for the diaspora to buy livestock for family back home.</p>

            How does the order process work?
            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>When you add items to your cart, the seller (and any service providers) must first confirm availability before you can checkout. This pre-checkout approval protects all parties. Once confirmed, you pay and your funds are held securely in escrow until delivery is complete.</p>

            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Garabaly has a dedicated negotiation feature built in. You can chat directly with sellers, ask for more photos or videos, negotiate the price, and reach consensus — just like at a physical market. Once you and the seller agree on a price, you proceed to payment with escrow protection. We believe price is a conversation, not a label.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">

            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>No. Garabaly is completely free for buyers. There are no platform fees, no commissions, and no hidden charges. The price you see is the price you pay. We only charge a small platform fee to sellers and service providers upon successful transactions.</p>

            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Garabaly uses per-party staged escrow. Sellers and service providers pre-approve your order before you can checkout. When you tap "Buy with Escrow," your payment is held securely — one escrow hold, per-party allocation. After delivery, you confirm with your unique 6-character code. Service providers are paid immediately. The seller's share is held for a 24-hour buyer protection window — during which you can open a dispute if something is wrong. If there's a problem, all unreleased shares are frozen and Garabaly mediates with dual-admin approval.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>If the livestock doesn't match the description, photos, or health certificate provided in the listing, you can open a dispute before confirming the transaction. Garabaly will mediate the situation. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, you'll receive a full refund from the escrow.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Absolutely! Garabaly is designed for the diaspora. Whether you're in Paris, London, New York, Washington DC, Brussels, Montreal, or anywhere else, you can browse livestock, negotiate with local sellers, pay with escrow protection, and have the animal delivered to your family's compound. It's perfect for Tabaski, weddings, naming ceremonies (baptêmes), funerals, or simply caring for your loved ones from afar.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Garabaly supports 135+ currencies through Stripe. Pay via card (Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, Google Pay) in any Stripe-supported currency — including XOF, EUR, USD, GBP, CAD, NGN, GHS, and more. You can also deposit funds into your Garabaly Wallet via card and pay from your wallet balance. Mobile money (Moov Money, Orange Money, Wave) and bank transfer are coming soon.</p>

            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Once the livestock is delivered, you have a reasonable inspection period to verify that it matches the listing. The specific timeframe is shown in your escrow details within the app. If you don't confirm or dispute within the allotted period, the escrow is automatically released to the seller.</p>

            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>For Tabaski, we recommend ordering at least 2 weeks before Eid. For weddings and naming ceremonies, order as early as possible to secure the best livestock. Our verified sellers maintain inventory year-round — the livestock trade never stops. You can track your order in real-time and call your family on WhatsApp when it arrives.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Absolutely. Many diaspora buyers coordinate the delivery timing so they can be on a WhatsApp call when their family receives the livestock. Sellers' WhatsApp contact information is available in their profile. It's become one of the most emotional parts of using Garabaly — seeing your mother's joy from thousands of kilometers away.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>To become a verified seller, download the app and create an account. Then complete the verification process by providing a valid ID and confirming your location. Verified sellers earn a badge on their profile, which builds trust with buyers and increases the visibility of your listings.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>When the buyer enters the 6-character confirmation code, your payment enters a 24-hour buyer protection window. If no dispute is raised during that period, funds are automatically released to your Garabaly Wallet. Service providers (butchers, veterinarians, delivery drivers) are paid immediately upon task completion — the 24-hour window applies only to the seller's share. Once released, funds are available in your Garabaly Wallet. You can transfer to other users instantly. External withdrawals via mobile money (Moov Money, Orange Money, Wave) and bank transfer are coming soon.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Absolutely. All escrow funds are held in secure, regulated accounts with atomic database transactions — your payment is never mixed with Garabaly's operating funds. We use bank-grade encryption, bcrypt-hashed PINs, SHA-256 checksums for data integrity, and comprehensive security event logging. Our payment architecture has passed a world-class security audit.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Every Garabaly order generates a unique 6-character alphanumeric confirmation code visible only to the buyer. When the livestock (or service) is delivered, the buyer enters this code directly in the app to confirm receipt and trigger the escrow release. The code is never shared with the seller or anyone else — only the buyer can enter it. This system prevents fraud and ensures both parties are protected.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Sellers and service providers pre-approve your order before you can checkout, so the order is already committed when you pay. After delivery, you have a 24-hour buyer protection window to open a dispute if something is wrong. If you don't confirm or dispute within that window, the seller's share is released automatically. This protection runs on our server-side scheduler — no action required from you unless you need to dispute.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>If a buyer and seller can't agree, either party can open a dispute through the app. Garabaly's support team reviews the evidence (photos, messages, listing details, chat history). Disputes require dual-admin approval for resolution — meaning no single person can make a unilateral decision. During the dispute, funds remain in escrow. We aim to resolve all disputes quickly and fairly.</p>

            <p>Your Garabaly wallet is protected by a private PIN that you set during onboarding.

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>You can report any listing or user directly in the app by tapping the report button. You can also reach our support team through the Contact page or via our social media channels. We take all reports seriously and investigate promptly. Our fraud detection system includes velocity limits and comprehensive event logging to maintain marketplace integrity.</p>

            How secure is the escrow system really?
            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Our escrow system passed a comprehensive security audit with a 95% compliance score. Technical details: atomic transactions with PostgreSQL row-level locking, SHA-256 checksums for every transaction, bcrypt-hashed confirmation codes (cost factor 10), dual admin approval for dispute resolution, and velocity limits to prevent fraud. This isn't a promise — it's our architecture.</p>

            What service providers are available on Garabaly?
            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Garabaly supports three types of service providers: delivery drivers for livestock transport, professional butchers for meat preparation, and veterinarians for health inspections and certificates. Each service provider is verified, rated, and reviewed by previous clients. All service providers are paid through the same escrow system, so everyone is protected.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-item__question">
            What are the different order types?
            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Garabaly supports four order pathways. By default, all items in your cart are independent orders — each with its own order ID and confirmation code. You can also place <strong>Seller-Only</strong> orders (just livestock), <strong>Service-Only</strong> orders (just a butcher, vet, or delivery), or <strong>Multiparty Bundle</strong> orders (combine livestock and services into one order). In bundles, you drag-to-reorder the fulfillment sequence — full autonomy over which services come after the seller.</p>

            How does order tracking work?
            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Every order has a real-time progress tracker visible in the app. You'll see each stage — from order placed, to seller confirmed, preparation, in transit, delivered, and completed. Push notifications and in-app alerts keep you updated at every stage. For multiparty orders, you'll see the progress of each party (seller, delivery, butcher) independently.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-item__question">
            Can I book a butcher without buying livestock on the app?
            <i data-feather="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Yes! You can create a Service-Only order to book a butcher, delivery driver, or vet independently. This is useful if you've already purchased your livestock elsewhere but need a professional service. The service provider is still paid through Garabaly's escrow for your protection.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Yes! Garabaly's chat supports text messages, voice recordings, photos, and video. You can also share listing details directly in the chat. Voice messages are especially popular — they let sellers describe their livestock in any language and let buyers ask detailed questions naturally. Messages are delivered in real time via our Socket.io infrastructure, with offline queuing so nothing gets lost.</p>
