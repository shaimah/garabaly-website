        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
          <p>
            By creating an account or using the Garabaly platform (app and website), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you must not use the platform. These terms apply to all users, including buyers, sellers, service providers, and visitors.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You must be at least 18 years of age to use Garabaly.</li>
            <li>You must provide accurate and complete registration information.</li>
            <li>Seller and service provider accounts are subject to identity verification.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and wallet PIN.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>3. Platform Role</h3>
          <p>
            Garabaly is a marketplace platform that connects livestock buyers with sellers and service providers (delivery drivers, butchers, veterinarians). We are <strong>not</strong> a party to transactions between users. We provide the technology infrastructure — including escrow, chat, payments, and order tracking — but the actual sale and delivery of livestock is between the transacting parties.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>4. Listings & Content</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Sellers are responsible for the accuracy of their livestock listings, including descriptions, photos, videos, voice descriptions, and prices.</li>
            <li>Listings must represent real, available livestock. Fraudulent or misleading listings will result in immediate account suspension.</li>
            <li>All content uploaded (images, voice notes, chat messages) must comply with applicable laws and community standards.</li>
            <li>Garabaly reserves the right to remove any content that violates these terms.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>5. Transactions & Orders</h3>
          <h4>5.1 Order Types</h4>
          <p>Garabaly supports three order types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Seller-Only Orders:</strong> Direct purchase of livestock from a seller.</li>
            <li><strong>Service-Only Orders:</strong> Independent booking of a service provider (delivery, butchering, or veterinary).</li>
            <li><strong>Combined Orders:</strong> Livestock purchase with added services in a single transaction.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>5.2 Negotiation</h4>
          <p>
            Buyers and sellers may negotiate prices through the in-app chat. A transaction is only binding once the buyer confirms the purchase and payment is submitted to escrow.
          </p>

          <h4>5.3 Seller Confirmation</h4>
          <p>
            Once a buyer places an order, the seller must confirm within <strong>24 hours</strong>. Failure to confirm within this window results in automatic cancellation and a full refund to the buyer.
          </p>

          <h4>5.4 Confirmation Codes</h4>
          <p>
            Each order generates a unique 6-character confirmation code. The buyer must enter this code in the app upon satisfactory receipt of the livestock or service. Entering the code releases escrowed funds to the seller or service provider. <strong>Never share your confirmation code until you are satisfied with the transaction.</strong>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>6. Payments</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>All payments are processed through Garabaly's secure payment system, powered by Stripe and mobile money integrations.</li>
            <li>Supported payment methods include mobile money (Orange Money, Moov Money, Wave, MTN MoMo, Airtel Money), bank transfers, and international cards.</li>
            <li>Garabaly supports 50+ currencies for international transactions.</li>
            <li>Funds are held in escrow until the transaction is confirmed. See our <a href="#escrow">Escrow Policy</a> for details.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>7. Wallet</h3>
          <p>
            Each user has a Garabaly wallet for receiving payments and making purchases. Wallet operations are secured by a personal PIN, enforced with bcrypt hashing and velocity limits. Wallet balances are maintained with double-entry bookkeeping and verified with SHA-256 checksums for accuracy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>8. Service Providers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Service providers (delivery drivers, butchers, veterinarians) must complete verification before offering services on the platform.</li>
            <li>Service providers are independent contractors and are not employed by Garabaly.</li>
            <li>Service provider fees are agreed upon before booking and protected by escrow.</li>
            <li>Users may rate and review service providers after each transaction.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>9. Prohibited Conduct</h3>
          <p>Users may <strong>not</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Post fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive listings.</li>
            <li>Attempt to circumvent the escrow system or conduct off-platform payments.</li>
            <li>Harass, threaten, or abuse other users through chat or any other channel.</li>
            <li>Use the platform for money laundering, fraud, or any illegal activity.</li>
            <li>Create multiple accounts to evade bans or manipulate reviews.</li>
            <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, hack, or compromise platform security.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Violations may result in immediate account suspension, fund freezing, and reporting to relevant authorities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>10. Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            In the event of a dispute between transaction parties, Garabaly will review the available evidence (chat logs, photos, order data) and mediate a fair resolution. During the dispute process, escrowed funds remain locked until a resolution is reached. Both parties will be given the opportunity to present their case.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>11. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>
            Garabaly facilitates transactions but does not guarantee the quality, health, or condition of livestock listed on the platform. We provide escrow protection and verification tools to minimize risk, but buyers should always inspect livestock upon delivery before confirming the transaction. Garabaly's liability is limited to the fees collected for the specific transaction in question.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>12. Account Termination</h3>
          <p>
            You may deactivate your account at any time. Garabaly reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms. Upon termination, any pending transactions will be resolved according to our escrow policy, and remaining wallet balances will be returned to the user.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>13. Changes to Terms</h3>
          <p>
            We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via in-app notifications or email at least 14 days before taking effect. Continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

          <h3>1. What is Escrow?</h3>
          <p>
            Escrow is a financial arrangement where a trusted third party (Garabaly) holds funds on behalf of two transacting parties. When you buy livestock or book a service on Garabaly, your payment is held securely in escrow until the transaction is completed to your satisfaction. This protects both buyers and sellers.

                <p>The buyer enters their unique <strong>6-character confirmation code</strong> in the app, confirming satisfaction. This triggers the release of escrowed funds to the seller (and service providers, if applicable). The transaction is complete.</p>

          <h3>3. Confirmation Code System</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Each order generates a unique, randomly-generated 6-character confirmation code assigned to the buyer.</li>
            <li>The code is the <strong>only</strong> mechanism that releases escrowed funds. Neither Garabaly staff nor the seller can release funds without it.</li>
            <li><strong>Never share your confirmation code</strong> until you have received and inspected the livestock to your satisfaction.</li>
            <li>If you lose your confirmation code, contact Garabaly support for identity verification and code reissue.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>4. Automatic Cancellation</h3>
          <p>
            To protect buyers from unresponsive sellers, Garabaly enforces a <strong>24-hour confirmation window</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If a seller does not confirm an order within 24 hours of placement, the order is automatically cancelled.</li>
            <li>Escrowed funds are returned to the buyer's wallet immediately and in full.</li>
            <li>Repeated failures to confirm orders may result in seller account restrictions.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>5. Multi-Party Escrow</h3>
          <p>
            For combined orders involving both a livestock seller and service providers (delivery, butchering, veterinary), escrow protects all parties:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each participant's payment portion is tracked separately within the escrow.</li>
            <li>Funds are released to each party independently as their portion of the order is confirmed.</li>
            <li>A delivery driver may receive payment upon successful delivery, while the seller receives payment upon buyer confirmation — all within the same order.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>6. Escrow Security</h3>
          <p>Our escrow system is built on institutional-grade security:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Atomic transactions:</strong> All fund movements are processed as atomic database operations — either the entire transaction succeeds, or nothing changes. No partial transfers.</li>
            <li><strong>SHA-256 checksums:</strong> Every wallet balance change is verified with cryptographic checksums to detect and prevent any unauthorized modifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Double-entry bookkeeping:</strong> Every debit has a corresponding credit. Our ledger system ensures funds are always accounted for.</li>
            <li><strong>Dual admin approval:</strong> Any manual escrow intervention (e.g., dispute resolution fund release) requires approval from two independent administrators.</li>
            <li><strong>Fraud detection:</strong> Automated systems monitor for suspicious patterns including unusual transaction amounts, velocity spikes, and device anomalies.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>7. Disputes & Refunds</h3>
          <h4>7.1 Filing a Dispute</h4>
          <p>
            If you receive livestock that does not match the listing description, is unhealthy, or if any other issue arises, you may file a dispute <strong>before</strong> entering your confirmation code. Contact Garabaly support through the app or at <strong>info@garabaly.com</strong>.
          </p>

          <h4>7.2 Dispute Resolution Process</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Escrowed funds remain locked during the dispute process.</li>
            <li>Garabaly mediators will review all available evidence: listing details, photos, chat history, voice messages, and order tracking data.</li>
            <li>Both the buyer and seller will be given the opportunity to present their case.</li>
            <li>Garabaly will issue a ruling within 5 business days.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>7.3 Refund Outcomes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Full refund:</strong> If the dispute is resolved in the buyer's favor, escrowed funds are returned to the buyer's wallet in full.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial refund:</strong> In cases where both parties share responsibility, a partial refund may be issued.</li>
            <li><strong>Release to seller:</strong> If the dispute is resolved in the seller's favor, escrowed funds are released to the seller.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
          <h3>8. Fees</h3>
          <p>
            Garabaly charges a service fee on completed transactions. This fee is transparently displayed before the buyer confirms the purchase. Escrow holding and release does not incur additional charges. Specific fee percentages are displayed in the app at the time of transaction.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-block">
