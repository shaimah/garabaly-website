            <p>
              Explore thousands of verified livestock listings. Use filters to find exactly what you need — by category (cattle, sheep, goats, poultry), location, price range, and health certification status. Each listing includes photos, detailed specs, and often voice descriptions in local languages.

            <h3>Chat & Negotiate</h3>
            <p>
              This is what makes Garabaly different. Start a conversation with the seller — ask about the animal, request more photos or videos, and negotiate the price. In West Africa, price is a conversation, not a label. Garabaly respects that. Reach consensus, then move to payment.

            <p>
              Check the seller's verification status, ratings, and reviews from previous buyers. Review the animal's health certificate from a verified veterinarian. Know exactly what you're buying before you commit.

            <p>
              Need a butcher, delivery driver, or vet inspection? Add verified service providers to your order directly in the app. Each service provider has ratings, reviews, and is paid through the same escrow system — so you're protected on every part of the order.

            <h3>Pay with Escrow Protection</h3>
            <p>
              When you've agreed on a price, tap "Buy with Escrow." Your payment is securely held by Garabaly — the seller does not receive the money yet. Pay via Orange Money, Wave, MTN MoMo, Moov Money, bank transfer, or international card. Multi-currency support means diaspora buyers can pay in EUR, USD, GBP, or any of 50+ supported currencies.

            <h3>Track Your Order in Real Time</h3>
            <p>
              Once the seller confirms (they have 24 hours to do so, or you're automatically refunded), track your order through every stage: confirmed, preparing, in transit, and delivered. Push notifications and in-app updates keep you informed at every step.

            <p>
              The seller arranges delivery or you meet at an agreed location. Inspect the livestock to make sure it matches the listing. Take your time — the escrow protection gives you peace of mind.

            <h3>Confirm with Your Unique Code</h3>
            <p>
              Every order comes with a unique 6-character confirmation code that only you, the buyer, can see. Share this code with the seller or delivery driver upon receipt to release the escrow funds instantly to all parties. If there's a problem, you can open a dispute and your money stays protected.
