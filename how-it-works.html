              This is what makes Garabaly different. Start a conversation with the seller — ask about the animal, request more photos or videos, and negotiate the price. In West Africa, price is a conversation, not a label. Garabaly respects that. Reach consensus, then move to payment.

Add verified service providers to your order directly in the app. Bundle 1 listing with up to 3 services (1 butcher + 1 vet + 1 delivery max). Drag-to-reorder your fulfillment sequence. Each provider confirms availability before you can checkout — and gets paid immediately when their step is complete. Per-party escrow protection on every part of the order.

Pay via Orange Money, Wave, MTN MoMo, Moov Money, bank transfer, or international card. Multi-currency support means diaspora buyers can pay in EUR, USD, GBP, or any of 50+ supported currencies.

            <p>
              The seller arranges delivery or you meet at an agreed location. Inspect the livestock to make sure it matches the listing. Take your time — the escrow protection gives you peace of mind.

            <h3>Confirm with Your Unique Code</h3>
            <p>
              Every order generates a unique 6-character alphanumeric code — one code per order, even multiparty bundles with seller + butcher + delivery. The code is bcrypt-hashed (cost factor 10) in our database. Case-insensitive entry. Maximum 3 attempts before 30-minute lockout. For escrow orders, the code is hidden from seller and providers until you confirm receipt. For cash orders, the code is visible to all parties after checkout. One confirmation, one code — completes both the order and all service bookings simultaneously.

              When a buyer adds your listing to their cart, you'll receive a request to review and accept the order. The buyer can only proceed to payment once you've confirmed. This protects both sides — buyers know the order will be fulfilled, and you know the buyer is committed. No post-checkout acceptance step is needed.
